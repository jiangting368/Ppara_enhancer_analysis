# Ppara_enhancer_analysis

This repository contains the full workflow for analyzing 4C-seq data related to PparÎ± enhancer regions. All scripts, configuration files, example data, and results are provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

---


## Workflow Overview
- **Step 1: Alignment and track generation**
  - Performed using the [pipe4C](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pipe4C.html) package.
  - Commands and configuration files are provided in the `pipe4C/` directory.

- **Step 2: Interaction site identification**
  - Performed using the [r3Cseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/r3Cseq.html) package.
  - The R script used for analysis is provided in the `r3Cseq/` directory.

- **Configuration**
  - All workflow settings (e.g., genome version, restriction enzyme, and sample sheet) are included in a single file: `config/conf.yml`.

## Data Availability
- Raw sequencing data have been deposited in in the Genome Sequence Archive (Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics 2021) in National Genomics Data Center, China National Center for Bioinformation / Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GSA: CRA026472) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa. 
- Processed results generated by this workflow are provided in the `results/` directory of this repository, including:
  - IGV tracks (`results/IGV_tracks/`)
  - Interaction site calls (`results/interactions/`)
